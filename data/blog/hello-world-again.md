As the title suggests, this is my come back to blogging. I did publish a few posts in the past but never stick to publishing more and more posts.

## Why starting again then?

I can think of a couple of reasons.

Firstly, I think it is time to teach myself the importance of the word **consistency** and see what the difference it can make to life. Recently I was watching a lot of videos/courses on the topic of **Meaningful Productivity**. If I take one thing home from these courses, then is the need for developing a habit of being consistent on the small things that lead to the goals planned for the longer time horizon.

Creating a personal brand in the programming space is one of my long-term goals. I think committing to a personal blog is one of the ways for this to achieve and is the best way to verify my consistency towards this long-term goal.

Secondly, to combat boredom and loneliness.

It's been a year and a half since I ditched social media from my life for good reasons. It helped me to get a lot of free time. And I was enjoying this gained free time with friends and family. However, I now realize this excessive free time also made me a lazy ass because I am currently apart from family (what was planned for a short period, turned into long term because of the pandemic). With blogging, I am hoping I could come out of boredom and loneliness.

Thirdly, I'm embracing the concept of **Learn in Public**. So I'll blog about the things that I learned or am currently learning.
